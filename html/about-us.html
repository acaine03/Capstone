        </div>

        <div class="paragraph-1">
            <p>Envisioning Your Future(EYF) is designed to help you if you:<br>
                have trouble managing finances, buying a decent vehicle, need help finding a place 
                to continue education, finding a place to live within your financial means, furnishings for
                your home and seeking counseling for all of the above and more!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph-2">
            <p>EYF understands that majority of us will not receive education in high schools on how to
                live in the "real world". Growing up, for most of us, results in a never ending cycle of living 
                paycheck to paycheck because that's what is "normal" in the world today. EYF wants to stop this
                cycle and give you something to look forward to -- financial freedom.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph-3">
            <p>Financial freedom doesn't mean you'll be rich or wealthy. It simply means that you will be able to 
                live comfortably and not have to worry about if you'll have enough money to pay the rent,
                or, if your vehicle gives you a "surprise" that will need immediate attention to be fixed.
